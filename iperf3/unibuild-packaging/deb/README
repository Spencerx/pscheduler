This directory contains support for multiple flavors of Debian and
Ubuntu, set up using the Makefile.  That build is triggered in the
top-level Makefile for the package (../../Makefile).

Files generated are in .gitignore so they don't slip into  version
control.

There is a specially crafted metapackage that  is  added  to  what
should be the master build OS control file. This metapackage takes
care of creating a dependency  list  to  get  the  correct  binary
package for each distribution we support. It only needs  to  exist
in one of the control files.
