# Note about Paris Traceroute

This is version 0.9 of Paris Traceroute.  It was mistakenly packaged
for Red Hat as 1.0 because the source tarball the developers had did
not have a version associated with it.

For Debian, we used the 0.93.ps version so to superseed the packages
provided by Debian and Ubuntu but not go over the official releases.
